# Operating System for DEcentralised Data Ecosystems

[![software by Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/software_by_dyne.png)](http://www.dyne.org)

<div class="center">

The DECODE operating system is designed to run on servers, embedded
computers and virtual machines to automatically connect applications
to a private and anonymous peer-to-peer network cluster.

## Usage

DECODE OS comes in a variety of flavors:

- for ARM based boxes (embedded)
- for virtual machines (cloud)
- live desktop (boot from usb)

Running systems provide a dashboard by connecting using a browser
using HTTP on port 19999.

The default username is `decode` with password `decode`

The default `root` password is `toor`.

## Support

Developers of the Dyne.org foundation are available to support
customisations and adaptations of this operating system for particular
purposes in line with the foundation's goals.

This project is a work in progress proceeding along a clear roadmap
agreed for the DECODE project. The DECODE OS stable release is planned
for 1st quarter 2019.

![Horizon 2020](https://zenroom.dyne.org/img/ec_logo.png)

This project is receiving funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement
nr. 732546 (DECODE).

## Build

The following instructions illustrate how one can build DECODE OS from
scratch, eventually adding software to it.

### Requirements

A GNU/Linux system is required in order to build DECODE OS.

Here a list of package dependencies:
```
zsh sudo cgpt xz-utils qemu qemu-utils
```

To clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DECODEproject/os-build-system --recursive
```

To update the repository:

```
git pull origin master && git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout
```

### Building

To enter the build console just run `./console.sh`.

To build a vagrant virtual machine, run `build_vagrant_dist`.

To build a live iso image, run `build_iso_dist`.

To build an ARM installer image, run `build_image_dist`.

Here below the sequences of build steps executed by each target:

```sh
build_image_dist() {
	bootstrap_complete_base
	blend_preinst
	image_prepare_raw
	image_partition_raw_${parted_type}
	build_kernel_${arch}
	blend_postinst
	rsync_to_raw_image
	image_pack_dist
}

build_iso_dist() {
	bootstrap_complete_base
	blend_preinst
	iso_prepare_strap
	build_kernel_${arch}
	iso_setup_isolinux
	iso_write_isolinux_cfg
	blend_postinst
	fill_apt_cache
	iso_squash_strap
	iso_xorriso_build
}

build_vagrant_dist() {
	image_${imageformat}_as_strapdir
	bootstrap_complete_base
	vm_inject_overrides
	blend_preinst
	vm_setup_grub
	blend_postinst
	vm_umount_${imageformat}
	vm_vbox_setup
	vm_vagrant_package
	vm_pack_dist
}
```

The `build_vagrant_dist` target is a helper that executes a sequence
of steps, some of them common to other helpers (hence
combinable). Here below the full list of build steps executed by
`build_vagrant_dist`

The `bootstrap_complete_base` step creates a base system tarball that
can be reused by any target, it is found inside `*_sdk/tmp` for each
sdk and to save time and computation it can be copied in place for
each sdk if the base system doesn't differ.
